									<p>
									After getting my Master Degree in Robotics and Automation (2012) with
									a background in computer
									science (Bachelor, 2009), I worked for a B2B company developing
									financial applications as cloud service
									, with a focus on robustness and reliability of the software.
									<br>In 2016 I got my PhD in robotics, focused on
									planning and control algorithms for humanoid and mobile robots.<br>
									In the teams I have worked with, I usually handle the complexity of the design
									and management of the software architecture and API.
									I like to take part in robotics competitions and to develop industrial applications,
									because that's where the difference between a demo and a working product becomes evident.

												<p><h5>Team leader autonomated navigation</h5>
													I lead 5 full-time software developers and created the team responsible for autonomous navigation,
													 localization and mapping. I introduced daily statistics for measuring the performances of
													 the robots along software releases, achieved the adoption of pull-request workflow with code reviews
													 in the entire software department and coordinated the effort and goals with the other
													 software team leaders in the company.
												</p>
												<p><h5>Software and motion controllers</h5>
													I developed the software responsible for communication and control of motors and sensors over the canopen
													protocol. The main focus was on robustness and error handling because the entire robot movements used this sub-system.
													The software reliability reached 99.9% of uptime with no human intervention required.
													I developed a differential drive controller that supports speed/acceleration saturation and safety constraints with Magazino
													custom-built drive base. The controller is used in all the different types of robots.
												</p>
												<p><h5>Embedded Firmware</h5>
													Designed the requirements and the architecture for the real-time
													firmware running on Arm Cortex M3. Tutored two students on how to
													develop and use the firmware.

												<p><h5>Humanoid Software Architecture</h5>
													I designed most of the software architecture used to control and teleoperate Walk-Man robot.
													The architecture included multiple operator and on-board computers, along with tens of distributed
													process interconnected by two different communication middlewares: one for high-frequency control
													on the robot, and one for low-frequency teleoperation and visualization by the human operators.
													Such processes were developed by a team of more than ten robotics researchers and engineers,
													in a common framework with multiple shared libraries and utilities.
												</p>
												<p><h5>Network Management</h5>
													I developed the robust networking software used to move information between the pilots and the robot.
													The network setup between operators and the robot consisted of a wireless link and an
													artificially degraded wired connection. Robot and operators computers were asyncronously connected by a
													set of channels dedicated to different prioritized information; the networking software was designed
													to survive blackouts longer than 60 seconds without affecting any running process on any computer
													 and automatically reconnect all of them once the connection was available again.
												</p>
												<p><h5>Operator GUI</h5>
													I co-developed part of the operator interface used to teleoperate the Walk-Man robot.
													The interface uses Qt widgets along with robotics middlewares (YARP,ROS) in order to provide
													a dynamic and customizable operator window. Customization is based on XML files read during launch,
													and different operators use a different set of widgets. By using the loosely coupled inter-process
													structure of the software architecture, multiple operators can have the same widgets on their own
													computer without affecting each other.

												<p>
												I believe that exchange of information and speed management are the key points for energy efficient
												traffic management. A time-space planner can provide both collision avoidance and speed control, while
												avoiding abrupt stops and acceleration. I designed two versions of a time-space planner, respectively
												in a discrete or continuous environment.</p>
												<h5>Discrete Search</h5>
												<p>
												The first algorithm is based on a modified graph representation of the space-time where
												the robotic vehicles operate. The proposed graph representation augments standard
												path planning strategies by allowing multiple speeds. Robots can make and exchange
												accurate predictions on their planned routes and speeds, so as to prevent and solve
												possible collisions. Indeed, the algorithm is formally proved to provide collision free paths. </p>
												<h5>Continuous Sampling</h5>
												<p>
												In the second version, a sample based approach in a discrete state and continuous time space
												is used for the trajectory computation of a single robot.
												The procedure is thus extended, based on a local robot information exchange,
												to the computation of collision free trajectories of multi-robot systems.

												<p>Moving objects with autonomous robots is a wide topic that includes single-arm pick-and-place tasks,
												object regrasping, object passing between two or more arms in the air or using support surfaces such as
												tables and similar. I developed a planning scheme which, based on the use of pre-defined elementary
												manipulation skills, aims to unify solutions which are usually obtained by means of different planning
												strategies rooted on hard-coded behaviors.<br/>
												Both robotic manipulators and environment fixed support surfaces are treated as end-effectors
												of movable and non-movable types, respectively. The task of the robot can thus be broken down
												into elementary building blocks, which are end-effector manipulation skills, that are then
												planned at the kinematic level. Feasibility is ensured by propagating unforeseen low-level
												failures at the higher level and by synthesizing different behaviors.
												Finally, a time varying graph is build in order to handle multiple objects in dynamic chains of robots.

												<p>I developed an online planner that computes the necessary steps to be followed by a humanoid robot,
												with arbitrary kinematic structure, to reach a desired position based on the scene captured as a point cloud.
												The proposed method provides a sequence of feasible footsteps
												in terms of kinematic reachability and stability according to a desired direction of motion.
												The best footstep among all possible solutions resulting from the procedure is thus
												selected. The approach has been tested on the COMAN
												and Walk-Man humanoid robots in different scenarios including stairs and uneven terrains.
